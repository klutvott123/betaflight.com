Yes folks Betaflight, albeit an earlier version than current, was the firmware behind the most recent record breaking success story for the “Fastest ground speed by a battery-powered remote-controlled (RC) quadcopter.”.</p><p>The Guinness World Records has granted the title to Ryan Lademann (USA), using his custom built drone called the XLR V3 Red.
