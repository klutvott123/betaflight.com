Oneshot 42 and 125 are fine.\nBTW its not Betaflight related, it seems the reason the Kiss FC works with the 24a esc's is because it only runs on 1khz with Kiss fw and up to 4 khz on Betaflight. The higher you go in khz the shorter the time before the esc's start to shutdown.\nSo the Kiss FC on BF fw may not show the issue because in the cold weather the flight times are short and at 4khz you may get a full 2 to 2.5min flight with no issue.\nMy advice for using these 24a esc's on BF is either run oneshot42 or run no more than 2khz on Dshot. This is not a guarantee but the best solution until a permanent fix can be found. The Kiss hardware is more than capable of running 8 + khz so I would say its just an esc fw issue.\njuuuut: No haste I'm on it.
