The shorter the pulse width the higher the likelihood and impact of this jitter. We have all seen an example of jitter in the receiver tab of the respective xFlight configurators.

In the case of serial each end of the communication needs to know the timing to utilise as consecutive bits in a 1 state are merely continuously highs (no pulses). The baud rate is therefore critical. In the case of DSHOT the timing is less critical. The reason for this is that the pulse width (duration) as a proportion of the total period denotes the bit value. This is very similar to the way in which WS2811/2 LED Strips work.
