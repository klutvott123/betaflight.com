The actual frequency of this noise at any point in time correlates with motor rpm. A single out of balance bell or prop will induce sine wave shaking of the frame and the frequency will increase as rpm increases. Obviously all motors make some shaking and noise, and the frequency obviously changes during the flight. The key thing is that noise from bearings or out of balance props / motor bells will be rpm dependent and will vary in frequency. Low pass filters deal very well with noise over a broad spread of frequencies going from low to high. A notch only takes out a tiny piece of it, leaving the rest untouched.

However, if we have the low point of a notch at 125hz and centre at 250, the implied delay for both points is 1ms.

It's why a machine with lots of filtering has problems with propwash, and in terms of propwash actually won't handle any better than 2k2k.
