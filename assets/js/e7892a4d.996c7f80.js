This is as fast as a motor can speed up or slow down. The normal PID responses to pitch and roll wobbles will not actually make any difference to motor speed until it has rotated to the opposite location from where it should have been. This means that pitch and roll PID responses in a rapidly rotating spin will feed back positively on themselves, maintaining or worsening the pitch and roll wobbles as long as the quad keeps spinning. Additionally, because the PID system is switching motors on and off randomly to deal with the massive swings in gyro values on pitch and roll, it does not put full authority into suppressing the spin. As a result the spin persists for a very long time. It is possible that at some point the motor speed changes may feed back positively into the spin. This bizarre combination of factors is what causes yaw spin to the moon events on MPU gyros. The key factor is having an extremely high yaw spin component. Very high rate pure pitch spins do not have this problem, nor do high rate axle rolls involving high rates of pitch and roll at the same time. But when pitch and roll is combined with high spin rates, logs show the gyros and PIDs going all over the place on all axes in a chaotic manner.
