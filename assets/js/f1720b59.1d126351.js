The goal is to deactivate the logic after a \"reasonable\" but short period of time once we've determined the craft is flying normally. However we want it to deactivate before we might reach the first point where a crash or other event may occur (like at the first gate during a race). Raising this value will delay the deactivation and it's possible that a crash or gate/branch clip could cause an unintended disarm. Lowering this value too much could result in the logic deactivating too soon and not providing protection in a runaway event. It's important to note that the delay is the accumulated amount of flight time where the other criteria like throttle level, stick activity, etc. are met. Thus the \"real\" elapsed time before deactivation may be longer than 0.5 seconds if the throttle was dropping below the limit or if the R/P/Y sticks were centered.

Valid values range from 0 to 100. Along with throttle level the logic also requires activity on the roll, pitch or yaw sticks along with the PID controller successfully controlling the craft with the PID_sum staying under control. When these conditions are met the logic accumulates successful flight time. Generally you won't need to adjust this value as most quads require around 25% or more throttle to takeoff/hover. The exception may be if you have and extremely powerful or light craft that is capable of flying well below 25% throttle. In this case you may want to lower this value closer to your actual hover throttle percent. If this value is set too low it's possible that the logic will deactivate too quickly and may not trigger in a real runaway event. Setting it too high will result in the logic taking more flight time to deactivate as it only accumulates flight time when the throttle is above the setting."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"tlm_inverted = OFF"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"tlm_halfduplex = ON"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"frsky_default_lat = 0"),"\nAllowed range: -9000 - 9000"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"frsky_default_long = 0"),"\nAllowed range: -18000 - 18000"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"frsky_gps_format = 0"),"\nAllowed range: 0 - 1"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"frsky_unit = IMPERIAL"),"\nAllowed values: IMPERIAL, METRIC"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"frsky_vfas_precision = 0"),"\nAllowed range: 0 - 1"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"hott_alarm_int = 5"),"\nAllowed range: 0 - 120"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"pid_in_tlm = OFF"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"report_cell_voltage = OFF"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"ibus_sensor = 1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0"),"\nArray length: 15"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"mavlink_mah_as_heading_divisor = 0"),"\nAllowed range: 0 - 30000"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"ledstrip_visual_beeper = OFF"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON\nWhen set to on, and the LEDLOW mode is active (i.e. LED strip off), blink the LED strip in synch with beeping, as a visual indicator in cases where the craft is too far away for the beeper to be heard / multiple craft are flying."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"ledstrip_grb_rgb = GRB"),"\nAllowed values: GRB, RGB\n",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://betaflight.com/docs/development/LedStrip#ws2811-vs-ws2812"},"https://betaflight.com/docs/development/LedStrip#ws2811-vs-ws2812")),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"sdcard_detect_inverted = OFF"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"sdcard_mode = SPI"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, SPI, SDIO"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"sdcard_dma = OFF"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"sdcard_spi_bus = 2"),"\nAllowed range: 0 - 3"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"osd_units = METRIC"),"\nAllowed values: IMPERIAL, METRIC"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"osd_warn_arming_disable = ON"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"osd_warn_batt_not_full = ON"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"osd_profile = 1"),"\nAllowed range: 1 - 3"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"system_hse_mhz = 8"),"\nAllowed range: 0 - 30"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"task_statistics = ON"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"debug_mode = NONE"),"\nAllowed values: NONE, CYCLETIME, BATTERY, GYRO_FILTERED, ACCELEROMETER, PIDLOOP, GYRO_SCALED, RC_INTERPOLATION, ANGLERATE, ESC_SENSOR, SCHEDULER, STACK, ESC_SENSOR_RPM, ESC_SENSOR_TMP, ALTITUDE, FFT, FFT_TIME, FFT_FREQ, RX_FRSKY_SPI, RX_SFHSS_SPI, GYRO_RAW, DUAL_GYRO, DUAL_GYRO_RAW, DUAL_GYRO_COMBINE, DUAL_GYRO_DIFF, MAX7456_SIGNAL, MAX7456_SPICLOCK, SBUS, FPORT, RANGEFINDER, RANGEFINDER_QUALITY, LIDAR_TF, ADC_INTERNAL, RUNAWAY_TAKEOFF, SDIO, CURRENT_SENSOR, USB, SMARTAUDIO, RTH, ITERM_RELAX, ACRO_TRAINER, RC_SMOOTHING, RX_SIGNAL_LOSS, RC_SMOOTHING_RATE, ANTI_GRAVITY, DYN_LPF, RX_SPEKTRUM_SPI"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"rate_6pos_switch = OFF"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"cpu_overclock = OFF"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, 192MHZ, 216MHZ, 240MHZ"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"pwr_on_arm_grace = 5"),"\nAllowed range: 0 - 30"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"vtx_band = 4"),"\nAllowed range: 0 - 5\n0=user, 1=A, 2=B, 3=E, 4=F(Airwaves/Fatshark), 5=Raceband"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"vtx_channel = 1"),"\nAllowed range: 1 - 8\nVTX-CLI-Settings"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"vtx_power = 1"),"\nAllowed range: 0 - 4\nfor SmartAudio: 0=25mW, 1=25mW, 2=200mW, 3=500mW, 4=800mW\nfor TBS Unify Nano: 0=25mW, 1=25mW, 2=50mW\nfor IRC-Tramp: 0=25mW, 1=25mW, 2=100mW, 3=200mW, 4=400mW, 5=600mW"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"vtx_low_power_disarm = OFF"),"\nAllowed values: OFF, ON, UNTIL_FIRST_ARM\nIf ON and the flight controller is disarmed, the video transmitter output power will be set to its lowest value (vtx_power=1).
