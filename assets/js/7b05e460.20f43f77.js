As you say, slowing the rate of onset of yaw moves using a lower acc_limit_yaw will reduce yaw responsiveness to stick inputs.\npid_sum_yaw indirectly limits the maximum speed the motors will be requested to attain during a yaw move. That will limit the maximum possible yaw rate, and reduce the climb rate to the same extent. Basically jump and yaw are inextricably linked.
