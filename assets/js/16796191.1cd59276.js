Using KISS24 escs and the KISSFC running BF 3.0. I can lower my P on Pitch but than it doesn't lock as good as it does with a higher P gain. But with a high P gain I nearly have to set my Ds to like 40. Is this good? and btw also using lumenier rx2206s. Thanks Thomas.\nBoris' Answer:\nIf its just the bounce:\nYou could try lower p setpoint weight.\nBut you could also try test dterm setpoint of 0.\nSee if the above 2 can remove the need for more D.\nBut high D is not an issue at all if the motors dont heat up and if it all still sounds smooth.\nThomas' Reply:\nSet dterm setpoint to 0 and no bounce back at all. Gonna try to go higher on P on Pitch and lower the D on pitch to get the feel I want!"),(0,a.kt)("h2",{id:"discussions-on-using-the-new-configurator"},"Discussions on using the New configurator"),(0,a.kt)("h4",{id:"there-are--marks-next-to-many-of-the-setting-fields-mouse-over-these-for-a-short-explanation-of-what-they-do"},"There are ? marks next to many of the setting Fields.
