Prior to BF 4.0, home point was updated on disarm but could be missed if switching rapidly. Best practice for launching in all versions is to arm, wait a few seconds until home point shows up in osd with 0 distance, and then start flying. Otherwise, disarm, wait a few seconds and repeat. Since Betaflight 4.0 you can use this cli command ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"set gps_set_home_point_once = ON")," in this way only the first arm after the battery is connected will be used as home point."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},'If you\'re using Crossfire, make sure to configure the Failsafe parameter as "Cut" on your "CROSSFIRE RX" menu.')),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"version-history"},"Version History"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Betaflight 4.1")),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"When GPS Rescue is engaged after a Failsafe, use sticks to recover control (",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7936"},"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7936"),")")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Betaflight 4.0")),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Prevent crash detection immediately after entering GPS Rescue mode (",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7034"},"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7034"),")"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Allow minimum distance to home to be configurable (",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/6404"},"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/6404"),")"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Fixed a problem with Sanity Check misreporting STALLED/FLYAWAY during the initial phase (",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7254"},"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7254"),")"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Added warning indication for GPS Rescue unreliable (",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7256"},"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7256"),")"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Added explicit parameter for arming without fix or low sats: gps_rescue_allow_arming_without_fix (",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7320"},"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7320"),")")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Betaflight 3.5.5")),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Fixed a problem with Sanity Check misreporting STALLED during the initial phase (",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7254"},"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/7254"),")")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Betaflight 3.5.3")),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Fixed problem with MOTOR_STOP and auto-disarm activating when GPS Rescue is active (",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/6979)"},"https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/6979)"),";")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Betaflight 3.5")),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"GPS Rescue activated on failsafe will check the quad to be at least 100m away from home, regardless of the Sanity check setting.
