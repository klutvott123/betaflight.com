I think the current defaults are a bit to much for some setups. Especially on end of fast flips or rolls.\nIn case some don't remember what the setpoint weight was doing. Just a quick explanation in easy language.\nMore to the right (higher)-> More stick acceleration and more sharpy on stick. Your quad reaches faster its target and the rates feel faster, but the motors work harder and have to break faster.\nMore to the left (lower)-> The accelerating and deaccelerating movements of your quad get more dampened. This results in really smoothed motion and pretty much never bouncebacks. Maybe better for freestyle.\nWeight transition is basically gradual transition of setpoint weight from center stick to full stick.\nBut the effect of it is not really small at the moment.\nComment from QuadMcFly:\nAlso worth noting your set-point will likely shift depending on your specific setup, so you can't assume it will be the same on every quad. Heavy, slow transitioning props will need a lower set-point than light fast changing props. For instance I had to run quite low on 5x4.5x3HBN props, but on the Lumenier ButterCutter I'm running almost all the way to the right. Basically I just turn it down till I stop getting bounce-back or \"slaps\" on hard flips and rolls."),(0,o.kt)("h4",{id:"more-on-setpoint-posted-by-joshuabardwell"},"More on SetPoint Posted by joshuabardwell"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"For setpoint transition, the wiki has a good explanation:\n",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"BetaFlight-3.0.x"},"Reference PIDC and Setpoint discussion on 3.0.x Wiki page"),'\nSo:\nDelta from error (high D term setpoint weight) has very sharp, immediate stick response. But may have problems with bounceback at the end of flips and rolls, and may provide less smooth flight (especially bad for some freestyle flyers). With high D term setpoint weight, the quad feels very connected and immediate, but also every. tiny. little. finger. motion. is translated instantly to quadcopter motion, which is not necessarily what every pilot wants.\nDelta from measurement (low D term setpoint weight) has smoother and slower stick response. Quad feels less connected and immediate, but is smoother. Also, measurement is best at stopping bounceback/oscillation at the end of flips and rolls.\nThink of entering a flip or roll as "positive" stick input, and exiting a flip or roll as "negative" stick input. When the stick is moving away from center, that\'s positive. When it is moving towards center, that\'s negative. Delta from error (high D term setpoint weight) is just as likely to cause bounce on positive stick input, in theory, but in practice, we seldom make sharp stick movements when making positive stick input. When re-centering the stick (negative stick input), the crossbar helps the stick come to a sharp stop. When making positive stick input, even when our fingers make very sharp moves, the stick does not come to as abrupt a stop (for most pilots). For some pilots, this will not be true. If you experience ringing oscillation or bounce when doing positive stick inputs, such as if you are doing a four point roll, then you may be the exception to this rule.\nSo then what is setpoint transition. Setpoint transition tries to give you the best of both worlds. When setpoint transition = 1, then NO SETPOINT TRANSITION OCCURS. The D term is calculated based on the setpoint weight, period. When setpoint transition is raised, what happens is that on positive stick input, the D term is calculated based on setpoint weight, and on negative stick input, the setpoint weight is relaxed (reduced) and the D term transitions from error to measurement. The goal here is to give you sharp, "error style" control on positive stick input, and soft, "measurement style" control on negative stick input. This means you get the advantage of error style control but without bounceback at the end of flips and rolls.\nHere is how I think of it:'),(0,o.kt)("ol",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Set the setpoint weight based on how much error vs measurement feel you want."),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Lower setpoint transition to fix bounceback at the end of flips and rolls (remember, default is low, and basically nobody complained about stops, ever, in 3.0.1)"),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Raise setpoint transition to increase stability at center stick (especially when running low P and/or low setpoint weight)")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"If setpoint weight is low, then setpoint transition won't do anything because the setpoint can't really be reduced.\nAlso, bear in mind that you should DEFINITELY be tuning P and D when playing with these numbers. P and D interact strongly, and setpoint weight interacts strongly with D, so these three parameters are all interlinked and tuning them is NOT for amateurs. What I would suggest is starting with the default values then tuning P and D as perfectly as possible. Then adjust setpoint weight to extreme values and feel the difference. If you like the softer or sharper feel of a higher/lower setpoint weight, try re-tuning P and D around that value.
