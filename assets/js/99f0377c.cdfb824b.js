They wind up up much harder for setpoint changes and hardly at all for board movements. This should make for some interesting flight characteristics.

I've set the I-terms to 0. My original understanding was that there is I term decay and I term gradually becomes less and less effective as it wound up and built up error would be forgiven after a while.\nWill try to tune some more. I did put the gyro on a perfectly flying plane, might be impossible to make it any better.\nPart 4:\nWell I've come to the conclusion that airplanes just don't need gyro stabilization, I'll keep playing with it, because it's interesting, the plane does fly. So far the only neat thing it has accomplished are hard stops for point rolls.\nI have D at 3 right now and it still has too much of a dampening effect, As you approach your desired rate it steps in and backs off the rate for you. Putting D at 0 and upping rates a little.\nAfter turning up the rates and getting rid of D it's starting to make sense. Going to lower my P on ailerons and introduce D back in there and see where it's at. Flies kind of weird, I guess we'll see if it works out.\nPart 4:\nIt is interesting to fly. I think the application is better suited to something that is less impacted by the extra 7 grams or so a Naze32 adds. It really isn't awful but you can tell it is carrying more weight. The plane I have it on is a Twisted Hobbies Crack Laser. It's an EPP plane for 3D aerobatics that has an AUW of 160-170g or so. I've been flying 3d foamies for many years now and it's the only thing that I'm pretty good at. Auto level works, I need to tune it in better though. With an airplane, especially a flat wing foamie like this one, the elevator doesn't control pitch proportional to servo travel. So it needs some tuning. It works really well for the roll axis, but it doesn't have enough authority on the pitch axis. I have to hold the stick full back to get it to nose up enough to fly, with 45 degree angle limits in place. The strength parameter of angle mode might need to have pitch and roll decoupled for this to work really well for airplanes. The weather took a turn here so it may be a few days or more before I can really mess with the settings and see if I can get it working well.\nI need to experiment with the D-term and the D setpoint weight.

So that is one bug that could be fixed. You must use an index between 1 and 8 when resourcing a servo. I tried to resource servo 0 and servo -1 to compensate for the strangeness and it doesn't let you.\nThese resources are also only applicable to the Naze32 I'm pretty sure. Other boards are likely to have a different IO and to determine where to assign the servos can be done with the resource command. You will be able to see where motors 1-4 are resourced and just swap in the servos to these places.\nISSUES:\nI've been having issues with the BF CLI by the way.
